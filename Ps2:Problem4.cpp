/* TODO: given an integer n, find exponent of the largest power of two that
 * divides n.  Example: if n = r*8 with r odd, then you should output 3
 * since 8 = 2^3.  (You are just recovering the exponent of the 2 in the
 * number's factorization into primes.)
 * IDEA: keep on dividing n by two until we can't, and keep track of how
 * many times it worked. */
